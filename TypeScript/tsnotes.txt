    Oops:

    1-class:
            -it is collection of data-member and member-function.
            -it is template  which we can re-use.
            -to create class we use class keyword

            this keyword : it referes to current class or object to access its data inside it only.


    2.object : 
            - it is an instance of class.
            -it allow us to access class data-member and member-function outside the class.
            syntax : let ObjeName =new ClassName()


    3.constructor : it is special member function of class.
                    -it will execute automatically when class object get created or initialize.
                    -in ts construction name must only constructor.
