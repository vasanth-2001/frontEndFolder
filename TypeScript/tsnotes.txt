    TypeScript:
        -it is super set of script.
        -it is compile language.
        -it is strict type language.

   
   to check node has install   cmd ----- > node -v 
   IF Present, type
   ------------->npm i -g typescript
    npx tsc -v   //check typescriptversion


    * how to ececute typescript file
    npx tsc filename.ts  // compile ts file and create an plain js file

    node filename.js  //to execute js file


    *variable declaration in ts
    *datatype in ts

    Task : write one parameter function is ts which will take two parameters and display your fullname.

    Task : WAP parameterize function which will return area of circle passing radius valuees as parameter.




    Oops:

    1-class:
            -it is collection of data-member and member-function.
            -it is template  which we can re-use.
            -to create class we use class keyword

            this keyword : it referes to current class or object to access its data inside it only.


    2.object : 
            - it is an instance of class.
            -it allow us to access class data-member and member-function outside the class.
            syntax : let ObjeName =new ClassName()


    3.constructor : it is special member function of class.
                    -it will execute automatically when class object get created or initialize.
                    -in ts construction name must only constructor.

* Inheritance
-accessing parent class property into child class.
-to perform inheritance in between class we use extends keywords.

*super() :
-it represent parent class constructor inside child class constructor.
-super method must be first statement in child class constructor.


4> Encapsulation:
-wrapping of data into single unit.
 
-access modifier:
        *public: we can access class property inside and outside class as well as in derived(child) class.
        *protected: we can access class property inside  same class as well as in derived(child) class.
        *private:we can access class property inside same class only.
5.ploymorphism:
-it is ability to take more than one form.
        -method overloading: when we have multiple method with same name in same class.
        -method overriding: when we have multiple method with same name in different class.

6.abstraction:
        -hidding implementation and showing necessary information.
        -we can achieve this by using interface,abstract class.


*module:
        -writting ts code in single or mutliple file and access it in another file.
        -to achice this we use export and inport keyword.
        -to send data we use export.
        -to access it we use import.
