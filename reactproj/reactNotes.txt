*React:

    -it is javascript library.
    -it is use to create rich user interface.
    -it create single page Application(SPA).

* Technology pr-requisit
    -html,css,js(basisjs,ESS5 and ESS6, Oops);

*s/w pre-requisit
-nodejs
-editor(vscode)

* how to create react project
    There are three ways to create react project
        1.by using npm:need to install configuration file.
            step 1: npm install -g create-react-app
            step 2: create-react-app my-app

        2.by using npx: no need to install configuration file.
        3.by using vite: it create project with minimum package.



*react folder structure
-node_modules: all the dependencies and dev-dependencies will install in this folder.
-package.json: all the dependencies entry will found.
-package-lock.json: detail description of file you will found here.
-README.md : it is guide file how to use react project.
-public: it contain static data an idle in it.

*react is component basis Technology
-component : it is partial part of react project.
            -which we can reuse throughout react project.
            -it can be any ppart of react project.

-in react App.js is root component.
render- displaying component output.
component-it is any part of your html file.


-in react we have two types of component
    1.function component: when your main focus is on UI design.
    2.class component:when you have to implement complex logic in thst case we use it.

* how to displlay component output
* JSX(javascript+XML):
    -it allows us to write html code in react.
    -it makes react code easy,in jsx we have wrap multiple element inside one parent element.
    -parent element must be any block element like div,h1-h6,p etc.

*props :
    -it is parameter or functional parameter which is use pass data inside compenent.
    -props return data in object format.
    -we can access props in function compenent by writing props.propsName. 
    -we can access props in class compenent by writing this.props.propsName. 

    Task-1 : VasanthFunCom  : create component and display output
    Task-2 : VasanthFunCom  : write  props with fname,lname,salary,gender,address and display its value.

    *method and events in react

    *state :
    -it is use to handle essential in class component.
    -it return us object type of data.
    -in class component we write state inside constructor.
    -if you want to use state in function component for that we use useState Hook.


    *setState : it is use to manipulate state data inside class component.
    
    Task : create a class compenent with name MyCounterComp having state with property count=0,
            you have to implement logic to increment,decrement and reset count value after click three button.

    * how to use bootstrap in react
    step 1 : npm i bootstrap
    step 2 : go to index.js file import the path
    step 3 : use bootstrap class.

    render : display component output or view on browser
    *conditional Renedering :
            -display component on the basis conditional
            1.use of if else: if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block.
            2.element as variable : in variable we store data and display inside tag and return it.
            3.use of ternary operator: short hand syntax for if else
                                        (condition) ? turepart :falsepart;
            4.use of short-circuit: if condition is true then and only then it display count.




*how to use css in react
    -There are three ways to use css:
        1.internal css:
        2.External css:
        3.module css:it is use when we have write design for perticular component.
                    -we save

*Fragment in React : 
    -it is an alternative option for jsx.
    -it remove unwanted element from DOM heirarvhy.

*component interation :
    -accessing data from parernt component to child component.
    -while performing component interaction in between component they must have parent child relation.
    -how establish parent child relation in between component,first we have to import child component in parent component 
    and then write child component name as tag in parent component.

*passing state data as props 
*passing function data as props 
Task :ParentComp (cc) : state empName,empSal and display output write method to manipulate state property.
                        pass props and access gender,contact.

*Pure Component :
    -it is use to prevent un-necessary re- rendering class component by preforming shallow comparision.
    -to achieve this we have to extends class component with pureComponent class.

*React.Memo ():
     -it is use to prevent un-necessary re- rendering class component by preforming shallow comparision.
     -to achieve this we have to pass function component name as an argument with React.Memo() Method.

*HOC(Higher order component):
    -when we have to share same bussiness logic with multiple component in that case we use it.
    -in this we share bussiness logic from function component to class or function component.

*Error Boundary:
    -it is react component which is use to handle error occur in component three while rendering component.
    -to handle it we use two class component life cycle method
        1. getDerivedStateFromError(): when error occur in component it execute automatically.
        2.componentDidCatch(): it will display Error log(error information).


*VirtualDOM :
