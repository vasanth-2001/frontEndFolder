*React:

    -it is javascript library.
    -it is use to create rich user interface.
    -it create single page Application(SPA).

* Technology pr-requisit
    -html,css,js(basisjs,ESS5 and ESS6, Oops);

*s/w pre-requisit
-nodejs
-editor(vscode)

* how to create react project
    There are three ways to create react project
        1.by using npm:need to install configuration file.
            step 1: npm install -g create-react-app
            step 2: create-react-app my-app

        2.by using npx: no need to install configuration file.
        3.by using vite: it create project with minimum package.



*react folder structure
-node_modules: all the dependencies and dev-dependencies will install in this folder.
-package.json: all the dependencies entry will found.
-package-lock.json: detail description of file you will found here.
-README.md : it is guide file how to use react project.
-public: it contain static data an idle in it.

*react is component basis Technology
-component : it is partial part of react project.
            -which we can reuse throughout react project.
            -it can be any ppart of react project.

-in react App.js is root component.
render- displaying component output.
component-it is any part of your html file.


-in react we have two types of component
    1.function component: when your main focus is on UI design.
    2.class component:when you have to implement complex logic in thst case we use it.

* how to displlay component output
* JSX(javascript+XML):
    -it allows us to write html code in react.
    -it makes react code easy,in jsx we have wrap multiple element inside one parent element.
    -parent element must be any block element like div,h1-h6,p etc.

*props :
    -it is parameter or functional parameter which is use pass data inside compenent.
    -props return data in object format.
    -we can access props in function compenent by writing props.propsName. 
    -we can access props in class compenent by writing this.props.propsName. 

    Task-1 : VasanthFunCom  : create component and display output
    Task-2 : VasanthFunCom  : write  props with fname,lname,salary,gender,address and display its value.

    *method and events in react

    *state :
    -it is use to handle essential in class component.
    -it return us object type of data.
    -in class component we write state inside constructor.
    -if you want to use state in function component for that we use useState Hook.


    *setState : it is use to manipulate state data inside class component.
    
    Task : create a class compenent with name MyCounterComp having state with property count=0,
            you have to implement logic to increment,decrement and reset count value after click three button.

    * how to use bootstrap in react
    step 1 : npm i bootstrap
    step 2 : go to index.js file import the path
    step 3 : use bootstrap class.

    render : display component output or view on browser
    *conditional Renedering :
            -display component on the basis conditional
            1.use of if else: if condition is true then if block will execute otherwise else block.
            2.element as variable : in variable we store data and display inside tag and return it.
            3.use of ternary operator: short hand syntax for if else
                                        (condition) ? turepart :falsepart;
            4.use of short-circuit: if condition is true then and only then it display count.




*how to use css in react
    -There are three ways to use css:
        1.internal css:
        2.External css:
        3.module css:it is use when we have write design for perticular component.
                    -we save

*Fragment in React : 
    -it is an alternative option for jsx.
    -it remove unwanted element from DOM heirarvhy.

*component interation :
    -accessing data from parernt component to child component.
    -while performing component interaction in between component they must have parent child relation.
    -how establish parent child relation in between component,first we have to import child component in parent component 
    and then write child component name as tag in parent component.

*passing state data as props 
*passing function data as props 
Task :ParentComp (cc) : state empName,empSal and display output write method to manipulate state property.
                        pass props and access gender,contact.

*Pure Component :
    -it is use to prevent un-necessary re- rendering class component by preforming shallow comparision.
    -to achieve this we have to extends class component with pureComponent class.

*React.Memo ():
     -it is use to prevent un-necessary re- rendering class component by preforming shallow comparision.
     -to achieve this we have to pass function component name as an argument with React.Memo() Method.

*HOC(Higher order component):
    -when we have to share same bussiness logic with multiple component in that case we use it.
    -in this we share bussiness logic from function component to class or function component.

*Error Boundary:
    -it is react component which is use to handle error occur in component three while rendering component.
    -to handle it we use two class component life cycle method
        1. getDerivedStateFromError(): when error occur in component it execute automatically.
        2.componentDidCatch(): it will display Error log(error information).


*VirtualDOM :
    insead of manipulationg browser dom directly react creates virtual dom in it memory,
    where it does all the necessary changes before making on the browser DOM.
    react render the code which needs to be render only that why react is faster.
*render array of object data in list.
*render array data in select option.


Task 1: create class component with name ToogleImgComp and toggle image after click on single button.
Task 2:reate class component with name MultipleImgComp and display multiple image after click on multiple button.
Task 3: create class component with name EmpDetails having state with array of object data. emp containing property like empid,empname,emppost,empsalary,
        empcontact,empaddress for 10 employees and display data in table format.

*routing of component   
    -navigation of component/
    -by writing routing path name in browser url to display component output or view.
    -we use react-router-dom library in react to perform routing

    * how to install react-router-dom
        npm install react-router-dom@6


    1.createBrowserDOM(): it is a method which takes array of type of data.
                          - in its object we use two property path,element.
                          -in this method we define all types of routing.
    2.RouterProvider():it helps us to render output of all routing component on browser.



    *Types of routing
        1.naming routing:display component output after writing component routing pathname in browser url.
        2.default routing: display component output without routing path name.
        3.parametrize routing: display component output after passing parameter with routing path name.
        4.child routing: display one routing inside another routing
                        -to perform child routing we use children property in object which array of object value.
                        -to display child routing output we have to add <Outer> library in parent routing component.
        5.wild-card routing(*): when user write wrong path name in browser url then we decide what component output should display.
        -in wild-card routing path we write path value as *
        -wild-card-routing always write at last,it below routing wil never work.




    * how to create layout for react project

    *Class component LifeCycle method.
    -it comes with four phases
    1.Mounting Phase: when component initialize
        -constructor:when class object initialize constructor get execute automatically.
        -getDerivedStateFromError: it is static method which execute automatically,and it is use to set value coming from props to state.
        -render:it is resposible to render component data.
        -componentDidMount: it will execute immediately after render method.
    2.Update Phase:When Dom manipulation is done
        -shouldComponentUpdate: it decides wheather component will update or not. 
                                -it return boolean value, if true then component will upadte.
        -getSnapShotbeforeUpdate:it return previous data of props and state before updation of it.
        -render:it is resposible to render component data.
        -componentWillUpdate:it will return updated values of state and props
    3.Unmounting Phase: when component is deleted
        -componentWillunmount : it just call before component deleted, it is use to disconnect component connection with other component.
    4.Error Phase:
        -getDerivedStateFromError(): it execute automatically when error occur in components.
        -componentDidCatch(): it return error log.


    *Hooks In React :
        -it allows us to use class component feature in function component.
        -by using hooks we can use state in function component.
        -in react hooks introduce in react version-16.

    *rules to use hooks
        -hooks work only in function component.
        -hooks always use in top-level component.
        -hooks can not be render conditionally.

    1.useState Hook :
    2.useEffect Hook :
    3.useContext Hook :
    4.useRef Hook :
    5.useReducer Hook :
    6.useCallback Hooks:
    7.useMemo Hooks:


    *useState Hook :
        -if yout wan to use state in function compenent fo that you have to use useState Hook.
        -it return two value,
            1.currentState,
            2.function-to-update-stateData.
        -before using it import it first from react library.
        Syntax:  const [currentState,functionToUpdateState] = useState(vale); 

        *useEffect Hook:it will execute after component render data.
            -it will handle work of componentDidMount,componentDidUpdate,componentWillunmount in function.
            -it takes two values 
                1.callback function,
                2.dependencies
            -Syntax : useEffect(()=>{},[dependencies]);

            case 1: when no dependencies values
                    -use effect will execute after every render.
                    Syntax :useEffect((=>{}));
            case 2: when we pass dependencies value as blank array
                    -useEffect hook will execute only once.
                    Syntax: useEffect(()=>{},[]);
            case 3: when we have to execute useEffect hook as we want.
                    -we pass value in dependencies
                    Syntax: useEffect(()=>{},dependencies)

*what is testing in React 

   

    unit-testing
    two software needed :
    *nodejs  find :  node --v
    *git   :  git --v


    -with react two library comes for testing:
     1) react-testing: it is use to execute or run test program
    2) jest : it is test runner or it provide platform to run testcases

    * How to create testing component 
        componentName.test.js

    TDD(Test Driven Development) : it is software testing process,in which test case before developemnt

    *to perform testing in react need to write:
            npm run test

    test("msg",function) method : 
        -it is the method which is used to perform unit testing
        -it takes two parameter :
            1.message : in this message developer write what is going to perform in short.
            2.function : in function write testing code.
            







=============================================================================================


describe(msg,function) : it is use to group multiple test case.

*coverage :it is tracking process it will tell as how much code  cover  while performing test.

*how to generate test coverage files:
    step 1: go to package,json and write in script tag.
        script:{
             "coverage":"jest --coverage --watchAll"
        }

    step 2 : in the package.json file add jest coverage code.
     "jest":{
        "collectCoverage":true,
        "coverageDirectory":"coverage",
        "coverageReporters":["json","lcov","text","clover"],

    *redux: 
        redux is used to store, manage, track the states for javascript application.
        (OR)
        -it is  predictable state container for javascript application.

        -redux work on three core principle.
            1.store(Bank):it is use to store state in it.
            2.action(withdraw,deposit,transfer):it is simple statement which are going to perform.
            3.reducer(cashier):it actually carryout state transistion depending on state and action and it return new state.

    *react project
    *redux library
        -reduxtoolkit
    *react-redux library: it is use to connect react app with redux or reduxtoolkit

    *how to install redux toolkit:
        npm install @reduxjs/toolkit

    *how to install react-redux library
        npm install react-redux


    *useDispatch(): in function component if you want to access or call action from redux for that we use it.
    *useSelector():it allows us to access state from redux
