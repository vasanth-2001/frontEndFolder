  * What is Javascript?
        - it is use to add functionality into webapp.
        - it is interpreted language.
        - it is loosly typed language.

  * why js is called loosly typed language?
    -when we create a variable in js we can determine what type of data is contain until and unless initilize its.
    -in the js variable we can store multiple type of data in it.
  * how to use js?
    -Threre are two ways to use js:
        1.internal javascript: in html file we use script tag and in that we write js code.
        2.external javascript: in this we create a sperate js file and import that js file in html file by using script tag.

  * how to get output in js
    1. document.write(): it will display output in html page. It will display output in sameline
    2. window.alert():   it will display output in model popup window.
    3. console.log():    it will display output in browser console or in terminal.
    4.innerHTML(DOM):    it will display output inside an element.

  *Hosting : moving variable and function declaration at top of webpage.

  *variable : it is use to store data in it.
  -we can create variable in js by using var,let,const.

  1.var : -it create function scope variable.
          -we can use variable before its declaration.
          -we can re-declare variable.

  2.let : it create block scope variable.
          -we can not use variable before its declaration.
          -we we an not re-declare variable.

  3. const : it create block-scope variable.
            - we cant use variable before its declaration.
           - in this when we declare a variable at same line we have initialize it.
            -its data will never change on run time.

  *exponentiation(**) :it return power of any number.

  ==(equal to) :  
      -it check value only and if both are same then it will return true value.
      Ex:
        5 == 5; //true
        5 == "5" //true
  ===(exactly equal to):
      -it will check value as well as its dataType and if both are same then it will return true value.
      ex:
        5 === 5; //true
        5 === "5"; //false


  * DOM manupulation

    function : it is block of code it is use to perform specific task.
              - function will execute only when we call it.
              - function can be reuse.
    * There are mainly two types of function
      1. pre-defined function : provide js to us.
      2. user definec function : user developed for particular use.

    Syntax : function funactionName(){
                //logical code
             }
             funactionName();


  * how to change attribute value by using DOM
  * how to call function by using event
  * how to acess data from input control

  * Array : -it use to store multiple values with same dataType
            - in array data store on index basis.
            - array index allways start from zero index.
            -we can access array values outside by writing arrayName[indexNumber]
  * array method

  *object : it is use to store multiple values with different data type.
            -in object data store in key and value paired format.
            -we can access object data outside  by writing object.keyName.
            -object type of data in denoted by {}


  *TASK:  create array of object for 10 employees have keys  id,name,post,salary,gender,age,city,state
            1.display all 10 employee information.
            2.display employee information who is manager
            3.display information of all  employee whoes gender is female.
            4.display information of all  employee whoes age > 55.
            5.display information of those employee who belong to tamilnadu state.


  * callback function : passing a function name as an argument inside another function is called callback function

  * Date and Time : 
            -if we want to display date and time in js first we have object of Date class.
            -Date object return information from the user.
              let objName= new Date();
        

  * form Validation


  task: perfoerm form validation for, password,email,contact,gender
