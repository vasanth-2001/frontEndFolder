*Angular :
    -it is js framework.
    -it provide desigining and development platform  for creating single page application.
    -latest version of angular is 18
    -angular developed and maintain by google

    -s/w pre-requisit
        -node js
            node --version
        -ts
            tsc -v
        -angular
            ng --verion // tocheck there is angular or not

            npm i -g @angular/cli //it will install angular
            ng new angularProjectName   //create angular project

        *how to create angular project
        step 1 :ng new projectName
        step 2: cd projectName
        step 3 :ng serve or ng s
        step 4 : go to browser url and write localhost:4200

        -angular work on componenet
        -component : it is partial part of angular project.
                     -it contain code for angular project,
                     -it can be any part of project,which we can reuse multiple time.
        -in angular root component name is app

        *how to create component in angular
            -ng generate component componentName   
            -ng g c componentName

            -when we create component in angular it generate four file 
                html,css,ts,spec.ts

        -how to get output of individual component.
        -go to component ts file and copy its selector name and write as tag where you want

        *dataBinding : getting or accessing data from one file to another file in same component
            1.interpolation {{}} : in this send data from  ts file => html file
            2.property binding [] : in this we set attribute(property) values ts => html file
            3.event binding (): in this we send data from html => ts file
            4.two-way databinding [()] : in this we can send data from ts <=> html
                -to perform two-way databinding we have ngModel directory but ngModel directive is not part of core angular module it is part formsModule, for this first wwe have to import formsModule in component.ts file import array.


    Task 1: create one component with name toggleimage in which on button click you to toggle image.
    Task 2: create one component with name changeimage in which click on multiple button change image.


    *directive in angular
    -it is use to change appearance and behavior as well as perform DOM Manipulation in angular.
        -There are three types of directive in angular 
            1.structural directive: it is use to perform dom manuplation in angular.
                                    -struictural directive denoted by *
                                    -structural directives are *ngIf,*ngFor,*ngSwitchCase.
                                    -we can apply one directive at a time to single element.
                                    -it is part of common module ,for this we have to import common in component.
                -ng-template display out on the basis of condition
                -to create reference variable in angular 
            2.attribute directive: it is use to change appearance and behavior of DOM
                -ngStyle: it is use to apply css stylce property on the basis of condition.
                -ngClass: it is use to apply css class  on the basis of condition.
                -ngModel: it is use to perform two way databinding.

            3.custom directive :the directive created by developer
                ng g directive directiveName

    *use of template refference variable
        
    *componenet iteraction:
    accessing data from parent component to child componenet
    -Input() decorator: it is use to send data from parent componenet to child componenet
    -Output() decorator: it is use to send data from child componenet to parent componenet

    *Pipes:
        -it is use to transform property value without changing its original value.
        -it is denoted by | sign
        -to use pipe first we have to import common module in our component
        -There are three types of Pipes in angular:
            1.inbuild pipe:pipe provided by angular 
            2.custom pipe:pipe created by developer for particular use.
            3.thirdparty pipe:pipes already developed by third party vender,first we have to install it and then use it.

            1.inbulit pipe:
                -string pipe
                -json pipe
                -number pipe
                -currency pipe
                -date pipe
            2.custom pipe:
            *how to create custom pipe
            ng generate pipe pipeName
            ng generate pipe shared/customPipe/cube

            Task: create one custom pipe with name square which will return the square of any number.

            *how to use bootstrap in angular
                step 1: npm i bootstrap
                step 2: go to angular.json file and in its style array import its path
                step 3: restart angular project

                layout folder
                Nav,pagenotfound,maindahboard,footer,login
                   ng g c layout/nav

                Form folder
                angform,utdf,rtf,
                    ng g c forms/angform

            *Routing in Angular:
                -navigation of component
                -to display componenet output or navigating component by using routing  in angular for it we write code in app.routes.ts file
                -in angular all routing componenet will display its output bellow <router-outlet>
                
                1.naming routing :
                2.default routing:
                3.re-direct routing:
                4.parameterize routing:
                5.child routing:
                6:wild-card routing: 

=============================================================================================================
12/12/24:

*how to navigate in angular
    -to perform component navigtation we have to use routerLink property with anchor tag,
    but first we have to import routerLink in componenet ts file from "@angular/router" library.

*angular form 
    -there are two types of form 
        1.UTDF(user template deriven form):
            -when we have create simple form validation in that case we use it.
            -to perform validation we have to use ngModl directory with input element
            -in this ngForm directory will hold data of all input element in it.
        2.RTF(Reactive Template Form):
            -whenwe have to write complete logic to perform form validation in thst case we use it.
            -to use rtf form validationwe first we have to import ReactiveFormModule from FormsModule in componenet.
            -in rtf we write form validation code in ts file.
            -in this we use mainly two classes 1.FormGroup 2.FormControl.
            -FormGroup : it will hold information of all input element.
            -FormControl : it will hold information of individual input element


*Service in Angular 
    -in angular service is special class with extra power.
    -it is use for multiple uses
        1. to share data with multiple componenet.
        2. we can implement bussiness logic in it.
        3. we can perform external communication(database connection)

    *how to create saervice
        ng g service serviceName
        ng g service shared/services/dbservice


        *how to access data from service into angular componenet
            -if you want to service data into angular for this first we have import service in component ts file and
             create instance of service class. 


        *REST Fake API
            -CRUD

            cd src/app/shared/database(enter)
            json-server --watch -p 8888 db.json(enter)


            *how to make API request from Angular to server
                -to send request from angular service to server for this we have to create instance of HttpClient class
                 in service constructor,but HttpClient class is not part of core angular it is part of HttpClientModule,so first we have to import 
                 HttpClientModule module,so first we have to import provideHttpClient as well as withJsonSupport in app.config.ts and
                  make entry of these library in provider array.
